# Standup Notes

## Kevin Truong

### What did I work on yesterday?
I overlooked the entire lab getting an idea of what is happening. Took note of anything that seemed excessively difficult or time consuming allocating accordingly.

### What am I working on today?
Getting a start on the specifications of the lab and going through and finishing it by the end of the night. Following the process provided of issues and pull requests (learning about them to use them properly).

### What issues are blocking me?
Some of the wording and descriptions is a bit confusing for me. I haven't ever used Git formally outside of just personal things so it took awhile figuring out the proper way to set up Github properly. 

## Joe (imaginary person)

### What did I work on yesterday?
N/A
### What am I working on today?
Working through with Kevin to go over and check the code to make sure everything looks right.
### What issues are blocking me?
No real issues are blocking me, we have some conflict of ideals but nothing serious that is problematic.
